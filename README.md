# Certificate Transparency Search
[Certificate Transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) log contains a lot of information about issued SSL certificates. This data is public and accessible without any restrictions. Possibly used for research or for example for subdomain listing, as does this PoC.

It's a quick and dirty botch, but it works. In a few weeks I' probably get around to rewriting it to Python.

It's based on [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/).
